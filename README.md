drusk-gwt-oracle-example
========================

This is an example web application which uses GWT and stores data in an 
Oracle database.

This project was completed for the introduction to databases course at the 
University of Victoria.  The premise of the project was to create an 
application which would allow international airports to keep track of 
airlines, flights, passengers, baggage, etc.  

The application allows the user to enter data into the various tables, delete 
data, view the contents of tables, and perform specialized queries which were 
part of the project specification.

Database connection information, such as the database name, user name and 
password are set in the DatabaseConnectionManager class.
